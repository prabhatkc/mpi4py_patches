## mpi4py based feature extraction/patch generation for Deep Learning from CT images

## Highlights

(1) Performs patch based feature extracting from raw training set in Parallel<br>
(2) Includes different options for data normalization<br>
(3) Includes rotation and scaling based augmentation<br>
(4) Includes air thresholding to discard non-contrast regions<br>
(5) Includes contrast blending based augmentation<br>

```
usage: main.py [-h] --input-folder INPUT_FOLDER [--output-fname OUTPUT_FNAME] [--patch-size PATCH_SIZE]
               [--normalization-type NORMALIZATION_TYPE] [--tensor-format TENSOR_FORMAT] [--random_N] [--rot_augment]
               [--ds_augment] [--air_threshold] [--blurr_n_noise] [--mpi_run] [--dose_blend] [--sanity_plot_check] 
               [--nsplit NSPLIT] [--out-dtype OUT_DTYPE] [--input_gen_folder INPUT_GEN_FOLDER]
               [--target_gen_folder TARGET_GEN_FOLDER]

Storing input-target images as patches in h5 format from all patient data /
category sets

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input-folder        directory name containing images
  --output-fname        output filename to save patched h5 file
  --patch-size          p96 or p75 or p55 or p42 or p24 or p12. p96 yields 96x96 patched window
  --normalization-type  None or unity_independent or unity_wrt_ld or std_independent or std_wrt_ld. 
                        For more info look at function img_pair_normalization in utils.py
  --tensor-format       other option is tf. Depending upon the DL API tool, h5 input and target patches are saved accordingly. 
                        Eg. torch tensor [batch_size, c, h, w]
  --random_N            extracts random N complimentary images from input - target folders. For more info refer to 
                        in-built options.
  --rot_augment         employs rotation-based augmentation
  --ds_augment          incorperate downscale based data augmentation
  --air_threshold       removes patches devoid of contrast
  --blurr_n_noise       whether or not you want to add noise and blurr input data. Non-funtional in for the mpi-run. 
                        Only works in serial run (for now).
  --mpi_run             if you want to employ mpi-based parallel computation
  --dose_blend          if you want to employ dose blend-base data
                        augmendation
  --sanity_plot_check   if you want to view some of the patched plots
  --nsplit              no. of h5 files containing n chunks of patches
  --out-dtype           array type of output h5 file. Options include float32,
                        float64, int16, uint16.
  --input_gen_folder    folder name containing noisy (input) measurements
  --target_gen_folder   folder name containing clean (target) measurements


``` 

## Example usage

`$ mpiexec -n 8 python main.py --input-folder './raw_data' --output-fname './results/training_patches.h5' --patch-size 'p55' --mpi_run --rot_augment -out-dtype 'float16' --ds_augment --air_threshold --dose-blend --nsplit 2`<br>
> > Instead you may choose to (modify &) execute patch generating bash file as:

`$ chmod +x gen_patches.sh<br>
$ ./gen_patches.sh`
